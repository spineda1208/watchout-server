# Database connection (REQUIRED)
# IMPORTANT: This MUST be the same database URL as your Next.js app (watchout-web)
# The WebSocket server needs to access the same database to verify Better Auth sessions
# 
# For local development with docker-compose in watchout-web:
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/watchout
#
# For Neon or other hosted database, copy the same URL from watchout-web
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/watchout

# Server configuration
PORT=3000

# Better Auth Secret (OPTIONAL - NOT NEEDED for session verification)
# Better Auth doesn't require a secret to be passed between services when using
# database-backed sessions. The session verification works by querying the session
# table directly, which is why we only need DATABASE_URL.
# 
# If Better Auth is configured with a custom secret for token signing in the Next.js app,
# you would need it here, but by default Better Auth uses database sessions which don't
# require a shared secret between services.

# Next.js Web App URL (OPTIONAL - for CORS or webhooks)
# If you need to make API calls back to the Next.js app
NEXTJS_URL=http://localhost:3001
